Back time ⌚, during the online course __Machine Learning__ (Fall 2015) by [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/andrewng) @ [Coursera](https://coursera.org/). 

I enjoyed this course so much that it motivated me to apply to study abroad. 

This repository has the assingment description and my solution for the module _Neural Network Learning_.
